* ICWS Chrome Devtools Extension
** Purpose
When developing for /Interaction Connect/, a lot of ICWS server calls
are made back and forth across the wire between the server and the
client. This extension attempts to alleviate some of the difficulties
and annoyances involved in digging through the network traffic logs by
bringing the relevant information up to the forefront and removing
irrelevant clutter.
** Build & Upload Instructions
1. Either run =make= in the root directory, or just zip the
   =./icws-panel= folder to generate the archive file.
2. Go to the [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard][chrome developer dashboard]] and log in with the
   =genesys.icws@gmail.com= account.
3. There should be a listing for the extension, including an "Edit"
   link. Click the link, then click on the "Upload Updated Package" button.
4. Choose the =.zip= file you made earlier and press "Upload".
5. Scroll to the bottom, press "Publish", and the updates will be
   available on the chrome store. Congratulations!
