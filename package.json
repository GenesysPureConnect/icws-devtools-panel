  "description": "* ICWS Chrome Devtools Extension\r ** Purpose\r When developing for /Interaction Connect/, a lot of ICWS server calls\r are made back and forth across the wire between the server and the\r client. This extension attempts to alleviate some of the difficulties\r and annoyances involved in digging through the network traffic logs by\r bringing the relevant information up to the forefront and removing\r irrelevant clutter.\r ** Build Instructions\r The node script =package-extension.js= is our compilation script. It\r requires the packages [[https://github.com/oncletom/crx][crx]] and [[https://github.com/archiverjs/node-archiver][archiver]] to be installed (simply =npm=\r =install crx= and =archiver=). Also, please remember to update the\r version number in =manifest.json=. It's kind of annoying, but it's\r also not that important.",
